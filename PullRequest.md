# Pull request

This is the easiest way to open a pull request only to this repository

[Click me](https://github.com/Skillbill/shoelace/compare/develop...Skillbill:shoelace:develop)

After the link click, select on the right the branch that yout want to merge on develop.

Another way is to modify the link before open it

`https://github.com/Skillbill/shoelace/compare/develop...Skillbill:shoelace:develop`

It's structure actually is

`https://github.com/<destination_owner>/<destination_repo>/compare/<destination_branch>...<source_owner>:<source_repo>:<source_branch>`

Usually you want only to modify `source_branch` with the branch name that you want to merge.

## GithubUI

The default is to open pull request also versus the forked repository
